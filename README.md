## Abstract

With the surge in cases in the second wave of COVID-19 in India, there is an unavailability of beds, and hospitals are forced to reject patients. The vulnerable population is crucially affected by this, they do not have the means or the money to use other avenues to cater to their needs..


Introducing our idea - **CoviHope**. Our idea revolves around the concept of utilising unused spaces. There is an extravagant amount of space in every community. We can utilize these avenues to treat a patient with mild or moderate symptoms within the community itself and reduce the crowd at hospitals. Our App will bridge the gap between frontline workers, doctors and the community. Users can consult doctors and get care with the apartment at home or the unused spaces in the community. Think of it like a mini-health care center within the community or locality.


The App was developed during BUILD AGAINST THE VIRUS (a virtual hackathon) hosted by ACM-W. we will continue to work on it to help the community in any way we can, pull requests ae always welcome :)
